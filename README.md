# NLP-Predicting-restaurants-reviews

In this project, we will predict reviews of restaurants.
We have a dataset that contains 1000 reviews in text format along with the sentiment of these reviews. The sentiment equal 1 or 0, 1 if the review is positive, otherwise 0 if negative.

The project is composed of 3 steps : Importing the libraries and data, cleaning and preparing the text and finally building the model.
Each step is detailed in the notebook along with the results of each operations for every manipulation.

Hope it's clear and enjoy!.
